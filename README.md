Swagger fully configured for JWT token usage, so Postman is optional.

! In case of Postman "Bearer " need to be removed before Token.

Before using any methods JWT token need to be generated (1) and inserted in "Authorize" form (2).

In-Memory Database used, so File need to be created first (3).

Also no need to publish Api anywhere, can run locally.

P.s.: I am too lazy to create junk Azure/AWS account or pay just for that :)

P.s.s.: Async/await not used, just to make code easy to read. But, yes Async/await is good practice to use.
